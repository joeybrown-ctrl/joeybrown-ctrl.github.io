# Responsive Portfolio Website

**version 1.0.0**

For week two of coding boot camp, I was tasked with building a responsive portfolio website. I began by wireframing my vision for my site on draw.io. The wireframe looked like this:

I created three pages in HTML: index.html, portfolio.html and contact.html. Then I made the leap to adding components and utilities to each page using Bootstrap 4.

## About Me

The About Me page (index.html) utilizes a navigation bar with working links, a jumbotron component, a fixed -- or sticky -- footer utility with media icons that link to my LinkedIn, GitHub and email. Other elements of the page are an image of myself, as well as some friendly but informative text, and media icons with working links to aforementioned social media pages. I utilized Bootstrap 4's grid system to create this layout.

## Portfolio

For the Portfolio page (portfolio.html), I added in images of each page's wireframe sketch as well as a brief direction to how to navigate to each page within three Bootstrap 4 card components. I did this as a stylistic choice as I'm only three weeks into boot camp and don't have many projects to show off quite yet. But stay tuned! 

This page utilizes a navigation bar with working links, a jumbotron component, the fixed footer utility with working media icons, card components and the grid system.

## Contact

The Contact page (contact.html) utilizes one of Bootstrap 4's form components, as well as a button component. It has a fully functional navigation bar, a jumbotron component, the fixed footer utility with working media icons, and utilises the grid system.
